# Scribble Demo ðŸ–Œ

Hi there ! 

Thank you for checking this project, we are trully grateful that you are taking time to test your skills for us ! 

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

### 1 - Make your own public repository on Github and start with the code we gave you

We've removed some components or functions here and there, and replaced them by comments in the format `// TODO` (in frontend) or `# TODO` (in backend).

All the remaining code is now in your hand and completely free to edit / remove / break. You can create or delete as much file as you want, reorganize the project, add/remove/change the libraries, anything ! 

### 2 - Start by checking your TODO list

Your goal is to complete as much as you can in your imparted time. 

We prioritized the TODOs so you have a kind of path to follow, but feel free to resolve any problem in the order that you wish. 

You also are free to do more than the TODOlist, like publishing the compiled app on your own server or developping some other features of the app !


### 3 - Do as much as you can to show us what you know ! 

We'll look at :
- The types of problems you solved
- The code you wrote
- The files you managed
- The commits you pushed (to assess your work process)
- The comments you left (for you or for us)
- And anything that you my want to leave for us to discover

### 4 - Send us your work when you're done (whenever you want given the time restriction, it can be sooner)

Give us access to your repository and notify us at 'devs@novalix.com' with the object of your mail stating your FirstName and LastName (just in case) and we'll take a look at your project :) 

## ðŸ”¨ Tech information

The project is currently an MVS architecture
